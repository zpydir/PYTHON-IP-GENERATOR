[PYTHON] IP Generator üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This tool generates IP addresses and save them into a text file, all you need to do is either to use my IP live checker tool, or use the ip2domain tool which i had already shared on Viperzcrew channel to get Domains or Live IPs from it.

Usage : 
python3 ip.py

‚úçÔ∏è Note :
Tool was found on pastebin but with python version 2 code, i updated and added new code. Am not the author of this script all credits goes to the pastebinner :

You can generate as much IPs as you want, like 1.000.000 or just 2.000. 

Works for Windows & Linux!
